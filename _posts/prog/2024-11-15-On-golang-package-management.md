title: Golang Package Management
---

One of the very few things golang manageed to get right (and the other languages got ALL WRONG) is package management.

# Statically linked binaries
All programs compiled by golang are stacically linked, which means you don't have to fight against the *thousand dot so libraries*. Does the binary ran once? It will ran always!
